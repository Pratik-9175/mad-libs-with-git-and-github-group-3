Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Sam,

I am writing to you from an exuberant spaceship in a tentative galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a maroon rocket in April. There are [6] [7] and [8] of [9] here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
5 months. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
flying on a dream rocket!!

Best wishes,
Noah

Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Sam,

I am writing to you from an exuberant spaceship in a tentative galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a maroon rocket in April. There are [6] [7] and [8] of [9] here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of Dettol. I fall asleep each night on a Alluring bed of
Goggles and dream of Swimming Jumping. It feels as though I have lived here for
5 months. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
flying on a dream rocket!!

Best wishes,
Noah
